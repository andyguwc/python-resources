#  Command Pattern
##################################################

# The goal of Command is to decouple an object that invokes an operation (the Invoker)
# from the provider object that implements it (the Receiver). In the example from Design
# Patterns, each invoker is a menu item in a graphical application, and the receivers are
# the document being edited or the application itself.

# Example: Each command may have a different receiver: the object that
# implements the action. For PasteCommand, the receiver is the Document. For Open‚Äê
# Command, the receiver is the application.

# The Invoker is configured with a concrete command and calls its execute method to operate it.

# Building a list from the commands arguments ensures that it is iterable and keeps
# a local copy of the command references in each MacroCommand instance.
# When an instance of MacroCommand is invoked, each command in self.commands is called in sequence.

# Instead of giving the Invoker a Command instance, we can simply give it a function.
# Instead of calling command.execute(), the Invoker can just call command(). The Macro
# Command can be implemented with a class implementing __call__. Instances of Macro
# Command would be callables, each holding a list of functions for future invocation
